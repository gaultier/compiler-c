- [x] ast: move to 'stack vm bytecode' representation
- [ ] ir: phi nodes/block arguments (when assignment is added)
- [ ] generate dwarf debug information
- [ ] ir: optimization: show diff output in each step, like git diff
- [ ] control flow graph
- [ ] data flow analysis (track r/w var uses including pointer aliasing) -> may require types first!
- [ ] simple alias analysis (type-based, conservative)
- [ ] codegen: aarch64
- [ ] codegen: riscv
- [ ] codegen: model register clobbers
- [ ] codegen: macho format
- [x] codegen: move graph coloring to LIR/ASM phase with the target data as input
- [ ] cli: choose target(s)
- [x] lang: boolean operator ==
- [ ] lang: deref
- [ ] lang: else branch
- [ ] lang: comments
- [ ] lang: loops
- [ ] lang: functions
- [ ] lang: structs
- [ ] lang: arrays
- [ ] lang: types
- [x] typechecker, pass type information to codegen for sizes
- [ ] lang: strings
- [x] spill registers
- [x] migrate all superlinear algorithms to hash tables or such (exceptions: graph allocator - but could also implement a linear allocator if needed)
- [x] pre-coloring of the interference graph based on register constraints (e.g. return value => rax)
- [x] lang: builtin assert
- [ ] codegen: link with libc & call linker
- [ ] codegen: make graph coloring more debuggable and track register pressure metric
- [x] errors: report all errors
- [ ] test: consider bytecode vm to test correctness
- [x] test: split files with expected errors from valid files
- [ ] test: consider checking output of compiled binary
- [ ] compiler: UI to show data about each phase in a visual way
- [ ] constant fold/optimization: use equivalence classes with union-dataset structures
