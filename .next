- [x] real test runner
  + [x] Spawn compiler in subprocess
  + [x] Capture stdout in memory. Only print on test assertion error.
  + Run compiler in verbose & non-verbose modes
  + [x] Spawn compiled program in subprocess
  + [ ] Spawn compiler in valgrind
  + [ ] Spawn compiled program in valgrind
  + [ ] Later/Maybe: Run tests in parallel
  + Later: check that `./main.bin -s foo.unicorn` == `objdump -M intel foo.bin`
  + Later: check output of compiled program equals expected output in comments => need comments, print
  + Later/Maybe: run compiled program bytecode in VM to check output against output of compiled program to machine code
    Or: compile & run program with official compiler to compare output (need deps).
- [ ] adapt amd64 encoding to use real sizes from types incl. right registers
