- [.] test(amd64): generate add forms
- [ ] test(amd64): generate sub forms
- [ ] test(amd64): generate cmp forms
- [ ] test(amd64): revamp `test_asm_gen.c` to generate only one file, maybe structured with alternative encodings. Consider running clang only once? Consider making `Amd64Instruction` compacter.
- [ ] builtin: implement println
      + Split `builtin.println` into a form for each type e.g. `builtin.println_u64`
      + ~Link libc?~
      + Implement our own? At which level? ASM?
